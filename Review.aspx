<h3 class="tittle">Mystery, Alaska (1999)</h3>
 
<p>In this comic drama about fame, sports, and small-town life, Mystery, Alaska is a small town in one of the least accessible parts of 
the coldest state in the union. It's a town where everyone knows each other and there isn't much to do. In places like this, 
small things tend to become very important, and in Mystery, the one thing that keeps everyone sane is hockey. Most of the men of 
Mystery are obsessive hockey fans, and a local hockey league has sprung up, with pools of neighborhood talent facing off on the ice 
every week. When a national sports magazine does a story on the hockey fans of Mystery, Alaska, someone at the National Hockey League
 gets an idea for a publicity stunt: send the New York Rangers to Mystery to play the local all-stars in a nationally televised game. 
 Most of the locals are thrilled; the game will give the people of Mystery a chance to bask in the limelight and make their sleepy town a 
 household word. On the other hand, in a small town where everyone knows everyone else's secrets, this event could cause everyone to start 
 airing their dirty laundry in public, with the whole world watching. Mystery, Alaska was directed by Jay Roach, who enjoyed considerable 
 success with the two Austin Powers films, and stars Russell Crowe as John Biebe, Mary McCormack as his wife Donna, Burt Reynolds as Judge 
 Burns, and Lolita Davidovich as Mary Jane. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi</p>
